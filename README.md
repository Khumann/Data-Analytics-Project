This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using data from the Kaggle API. In the Extract phase, we download the dataset from Kaggle, which requires an API key.In the Transform phase, we clean the data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring overall data integrity. Finally, in the Load phase, we establish a connection to a MySQL server and upload the cleaned data for storage and subsequent analysis. This setup provides a comprehensive framework for managing data-driven projects, facilitating efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading into a database for further use.
